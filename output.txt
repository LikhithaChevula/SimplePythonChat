Client types message → sends to server → server receives → server prints → server types reply → sends to client → client prints reply


* Server must run first.
* Client waits for server reply every time.
* Typing exit stops the conversation.
* Messages are line-by-line, no concurrency here.

Step 1: Start the client
Command:
python client.py

First thing you see:
Message:

This is from the line:
client.send(input("Message:").encode('utf-8'))
It waits for you to type something.
The program pauses here until you enter text.

Step 2: You type a message
Example:
Message: Hello

What happens internally:
The client sends "Hello" to the server.
Server receives "Hello" and prints:
Received: Hello
Server asks you (on its terminal) to type a reply:
Message:
You type "Hi" on the server.
Server sends "Hi" back to the client.

Step 3: Client receives reply
The client prints:
Received from server: Hi

From this line:
print('Received from server:', msg)
Shows exactly what server replied.

Step 4: Repeat messages
Example sequence:
Client terminal:
Message: How are you?
Received from server: I am fine
Message: exit
Server terminal:
Received: How are you?
Message: I am fine
Received: exit

The loop continues until either client or server sends "exit".

Step 5: Exit
When the client receives "exit" from the server:
done = True
The loop stops.
Client closes connection:
client.close()

Nothing is printed after that. The program ends.
